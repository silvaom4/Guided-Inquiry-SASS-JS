# Guided-Inquiry-SASS-JS

Welcome to my budget tracker project.

Please fill out the appropriate areas to help manage your budget. 
The budget tracker will calculate income, expenses and result in a total budget. 

Below are the requirements for this project.

Requirements:
User Interface --
The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Include input fields to enter income and expense descriptions.
Provide input fields to enter income and expense amounts.
Add buttons to add income and expenses.
Display the total budget, income, and expenses on the UI.

Budget Calculation -- 
The application should calculate the total budget based on the income and expenses entered by the user.
The total budget should be updated whenever a new income or expense is added.
The income and expenses should be stored in separate arrays or objects.
The application should correctly handle positive income and negative expenses.

Functionality --
Implement the ability to add income by entering a description and amount.
Implement the ability to add expenses by entering a description and amount.
The application should prevent the user from submitting empty input fields or invalid amounts.
Provide proper validation and error handling for input fields.

Display Summary --
Display the calculated income, expenses, and total budget on the UI.
The summary should be updated dynamically whenever a new income or expense is added.

Object-Oriented Programming: --
Implement a Budget class with properties and methods to handle income, expenses, and total budget.
Encapsulate the budget-related functionality within the Budget class.
Utilize object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, or polymorphism in your implementation.

Testing: --
Manually test the application by entering various income and expense scenarios.
Verify that the total budget is calculated correctly and displayed accurately on the UI.
Ensure that the income and expenses are stored and displayed correctly.

Documentation: --
Include comments in your code to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.
Provide a brief explanation of how to use the application in the README file.

Styling --
Create a SASS variable called "primary-color" and assign it a hex-code color value of your choice. Use this variable to set the color of a heading element.
Write a SASS mixin called "gradient" that takes two colors as arguments and creates a linear gradient background. Use this mixin to set the background color of the webpage.
Add styles to make the application visually appealing and easy to use.
*Optional Styling Items: 
Create a SASS mixin called "animations" that generates keyframe animations based on a set of parameters like duration, easing, and keyframe rules. Use this mixin to create complex animations for different elements on a webpage.
Create a design system with global variables for colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements. Use these variables to create consistent styles in your project.

Hosting --
Your site must be hosted on one of the following platforms: Vercel, AWS Amplify, GitHub Pages, or Netlify.
